## From PHX Airport

Phoenix Sky Harbor [PHX](https://www.skyharbor.com/) airport has direct connections to all major hubs in the US.

PHX airport is 5.5 miles (10 minutes by car/rideshare) from the workshop venue.

### Public transport (Light Rail)

The [Valley Metro Light Rail][Light Rail] connects the airport to Tempe along a
West-East axis. If your destination is near a Light Rail stop then
public transport works well:

1. Take the free [PHX Sky Train][] from the terminal to the **44th St/Washington**
Metro Rail stop.
2. Walk from the Sky Train stop to the Light Rail stop (all inside the 44th St
Sky Train structure).
3. Buy a ticket at the ticket machine near the exit escalators to the Light
Rail stop.
4. At the [44th St/Washington stop][LightRail44thSt] (Stop #10018) take the
*east-bound* Light Rail (direction Mesa, Gilbert Rd/Main St).
5. The stop closest to the Hyatt Place Hotel and the workshop venue is
**University Dr/Rural Rd** (Stop #10023). If you want to get off closer to
downtown Tempe get off one stop earlier at **Veterans Way/College Ave** (Stop #10025).
6. Walk to your destination. (See below)

### Car/rideshare

To get from the airport to anywhere in Tempe either take a cab (traditional or self-driving
Waymo) or rideshare (Lyft, Uber).
