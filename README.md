# MDAnalysis UGM 2025

The [2025 MDAnalysis User Group Meeting](https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/ugm2025/) (UGM) will bring together users and developers of the MDAnalysis package from different communities. Our goal is to foster an interdisciplinary opportunity to connect for researchers and developers across biomolecular simulations, soft matter, biophysics and more. This repository includes relevant materials for the UGM.

## When and Where

## Health and Safety
We are committed to providing a safe, comfortable, and healthy environment for the MDAnalysis UGM and have looked to local and international entities and other organizations in the open source community to develop onsite safety measures for UGM attendees.


## IT Logistics

### Connecting to the Wireless Network/WiFi

* The **asu guest** wireless network is available to all participants but limited in capabilities.
* The **eduroam** network is available to anyone whose institution participates in eduroam. If you need to set up anything, talk to your institution's IT support before coming to ASU.
* The **asu** network is only available to members of Arizona State University.

See [CONNECTIVITY](CONNECTIVITY.md) for details.


### GitHub account and Code Spaces

In order to participate in some of the workshops you will need to be able to run a [Code Space](https://github.com/features/codespaces) instance in your personal GitHub account. This requires a GitHub account and either free or paid credits. For most users, the monthly free Codespaces allowance on their *individual* accounts (120 core hours, 15 GB storage) should be sufficient.
