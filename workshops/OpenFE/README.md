## OpenFE workshop @ MDAnalysis UGM2025

# OpenFE Demo: USRSE 2025

## Installing openfe 

Note that OpenFE and OpenFF are using the same environment for our workshops - if you've 
installed one environment, you're ready for both workshops!

Installing from conda-forge is simplest, and you can use `micromamba` (suggested), `mamba` or `conda`:

```bash

micromamba create -f openff-openfe-environment.yaml
micromamba activate openff-openfe

```

then open the demo with `jupyter notebook openfe_workshop.ipynb`.

See the [openfe git repo](https://github.com/OpenFreeEnergy/openfe) and [documentation](https://docs.openfree.energy/en/latest/) to learn more!
