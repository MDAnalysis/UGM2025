# IMD-streaming workshop

The Streaming session will have a hands-on, interactive workshop focused on live streaming and analysis of simulation data using MDAnalysis. Participants will learn to connect to running MD simulations using Interactive Molecular Dynamics (IMD) and perform real-time analysis using MDAnalysis. The workshop will cover the following topics:

- Connect to live MD simulations via IMD streaming and stream data to MDAnalysis
- Perform real-time monitoring of simulations
- Analyze and visualize MD properties on-the-fly
- Implement adaptive and selective sampling strategies

The workshop will also include hands-on exercises where participants can practice connecting to live simulations and performing various analyses in real-time. Basic knowledge of molecular dynamics simulations and some familiarity with using MDAnalysis is recommended.

The workshop is scheduled for 60 minutes and will be conducted in an online development environment (GitHub Codespaces). Participants are encouraged to bring their own laptops with WiFi access to participate and follow along with the exercises.

**When & Where:**
- **Time:** 4:05 PM - 5:05 PM
- **Location:** PSF 186
- **Presenter:** Amruthesh Thirumalaiswamy
