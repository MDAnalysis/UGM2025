## OpenFF workshop @ MDAnalysis UGM2025

[Open Force Field](http://openforcefield.org) is a nonprofit organization that develops a [generalized force field](https://openforcefield.org/force-fields/force-fields/) for the scientific community and develops tools to create atomistic force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. 

In this **75 min** tutorial you will learn:
1) How to apply the OpenFF-Toolkit and OpenFF-Interchange to build a parametrized simulation box and run with OpenMM
2) About our force field options including our newly released AshGC neural network charges and our Sage 2.3.0-alpha release for protein simulations.

### Installation

Create a new conda environment for this workshop with:
```bash
conda create -f environment.yaml
conda activate openff-env
```

### Get Connected
We firmly believe in providing our tools and data freely for transparent reproducibility and alternative use. If your organization wishes to collaborate with us, we are [eager to work with](https://openforcefield.org/how-to-join/) additional partners!
